# Naive Bayesian Classifier

## Bayes Theorem

- P(A|B) :- Probability of event A given that b is true
- P(B|A) :- Probability of events given that A is true

## Bayes Classifier

- Probabilistic ML Algorithm based on Bayes Theorem
- with `Naive` assumption that all features are independent given the class label

## Naive Bayes

### Types of Naive Bayes

- Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Continuous Features and distributed
  - Iris Dataset
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Discrete Features. meaning count for frequencency
  - Text Classification
- Categorical Naive Bayes
  - Features are Categorical
  - weather data
- Bernominal Naive Bayes
  - Binary features
  - spam detection

## Advantages of Naive Bayes

- Fast & Efficient
  - Works well on large Datasets
- Simple to Implement
- Robust to irrelevant features

## Limitations

- Strong Independent Mindset
  - All features are independent from thier labels
